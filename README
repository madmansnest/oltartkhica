**This has been long abandoned as it has problems that are impossible to solve using plain fonts like i tried to to. Maybe OpenType/Graphite could be used but i am not currently interested in researching that.**

Oltartkʰica — a cheap Ithkuil font
===

Oltartkhica is a project to create a cheap font for Ithkuil writing system. Ithkuil and its writing system are ©2004-2011 by John Quijada. This font is a derivative work with a mere goal to facilitate using Ithkuil script on a computer.

## Installation

Just install Oltarkhica-Regular-A.otf, Oltarkhica-Regular-B.otf, and Oltarkhica-Regular-C.otf by clicking the file and choosing ‘Install font’ or as otherwise appropriate for your system.

## Encoding

Characters of the Ithkuil writing system are encoded using Unicode Private Use Areas. This font is currently a work in progress which means details of encoding and order of the characters might be subject to change.

Because of the limit of 65534 characters per one font file it is impossible to put all the glyphs into single file. This in turn makes OpenType ligatures that were previously considered as a way of dealing with characters with extensions, are unusable, because unless if the components and the ligature are in different font files, the ligature cannot be displayed.

Because Ithkuil writing system is very complex, more than a hundred thousand  codepoints is required. Therefore, Ithkuil characters occupy a small part of Private Use Area on the Basic Multilingual Plane, as well as all of the Supplementary Private Use Area-A and most of Supplementary Private Use Area-B.

Basic Itkuil characters are encoded starting at the beginning of the Unicode Private Use Area on the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+E000 and forth). Glyphs of characters with extensions start at the beginning of Supplementary Private Use Area-A (U+F0000) and with the exception of non-characters U+FFFFE and U+FFFFF continue to Supplementary Private Use Area-B.

It is logical therefore to split the font into three files for each Unicode plane. (Alternatively, because the font does not use all the )

Suggested order in which characters are encoded is provided in the file Encoding.txt.

## Glyphs with extensions

Due to the fact that every of 96 Primary Case Characters can simultaneously take 17 extensions for Configuration&Essence to its top part and 23 extensions for Extension&Affiliation to the bottom part, a total number of glyphs required for Primary Case Characters is 96×18×24 = 41472. Similarly, every of 46 Consonantal Characters and their 46 Vertically Inverted Counterparts can take 17 extensions for Pattern, Stem and Relation to horizontal bar and 32 extensions for Consonant Affixes to its vertical line, therefore the total number of glyphs required for Consonantal Characters is 92×18×30 = 49680.

Such an enourmous number of glyphs that rivals that of CJK characters, is implausible to create by hand. However due to the very regular nature of ligatures it is perfectly possible to automate most of the process.

Only basic (non-reversed non-inverted characters) with a single extension require some manual work, i.e. modifying the end of the line and placing the extension in the right place. [For Primary characters it is 25 characters with 17 top extensions plus 25 characters with 23 bottom extensions, or 1000 glyphs. For Consonantal Characters that is 23 characters with 17 horizontal bar extensions plus 23 characters with 32 vertical line extensions (including historical ex), or 1127 glyphs. Because modifying a glyph is easier than drawing a new one, it is doable (and have been done) by a single person in a several days’ time. Laterally Reversed and Vertically Inverted Characters are created using  flipped references in FontForge. And glyphs for characters with both top and bottom extensions are created by a script that takes splineset for the character with one extension and patches to it the result of a diff between a basic character and the character with another extension.

The system requires that the basic glyph is not moved while editing the extension, and that the other end of the character left exactly as it is in the basic character.

## Placeholder characters

Consonantal Placeholder characters (Horizontal Bar, Laterally Reversed Horizontal Bar and Vertical Bar) are encoded as separate characters, partially for historical reasons, partially because they may find uses when it is needed to show what they look like. IME also uses Vertical Bar as, well, you guessed it, placeholder to show diacritics that are placed above Consonantal characters.

However, now that ligatures are not used any more, glyphs for characters that represent extensions have been redrawn so that they include either a horizontal or a vertical bar, therefore, they will be used not only as cues for IME, but also in their own right to show additional consonantal suffixes and bias.

### Glyphs for placeholder characters

As stated in Section 11.3.4.10 of the Grammar, Horizontal Bar is used to mark Bias in the words which do not have a Derivational Suffix, and Laterally Reversed Horizontal Bar is used in such words instead of the vertical-bar diacritic. Vertical Bar is mentioned in Section 11.3.4.3 of the Grammar and is used if a single Consonantal Character with extensions and diacritics is not enough to represent a triconsonantal or a tetraconsonantal root. Notice that Vertical Bar is different from similarly looking Secondary Placeholder Character, and the visual style of the glyph follows that of Consonantal Characters.

Notice that as there are only 16 of 17 horizontal bar extensions used to represent Bias, the Horizontal Bar with a P1S1+FRA character is not needed. However, it is still present in the font. The reason is the non-standard usage that is described below.

### Proposed Non-standard usage for the Horizontal Bar character

A shortcut method of writing borrowed words in Ithkuil is proposed as follows. Instead of official orthographic usage of consonantal character _p_ for carrier root and following it with transliteration enclosed within transliteration signs, in place of basic consonantal character the original script in the foreign language is put, followed by a Horizontal Bar character with the extensions for Pattern, Stem and Relation of the carrier root as well as all necessary diacritics. While this might be thought to disrupt the unified visual style of Ithkuil script, using original foreign orthography within a writing system is exteremely common, and even when two writing systems have a completely different look and feel, they can be intermixed, e.g. foreign words written in Latin script may occur within Chinese and Japanese text, even in vertical writing.

Aside from removing the need for transliteration and making (in come cases) the writing more compact, this makes it possible to express in written Ithkuil even the words that cannot yet be used in spoken Ithkuil, e.g. using an ideograhic character in place of unassigned root for which the consonantal form is not yet known.

## Input and displaying Ithkuil text in the browser

There is an IME written in Javascript in the font package that can be used to type Ithkuil. See IME.txt for more information. The IME also provides a stylesheet and is an example of using Oltartkhica font on a web page.

## Known shortcomings

### Urgent bugs

* Primary Characters 51 CMP/3 ABS and 75 CMP1C/27 ESS with extensions got mixed.
* Merging algorythm is imperfect and does not merge some characters with some modifiers correctly. Maybe it is necessary to use a character-by-character rather than line-by-line.

### More systemic problems

* Glyphs U+E08D to U+E0BF shall be reworked using references to parts in the first Secondary character glyphs.
* Primary characters shall be reworked because the line width varies from character to character, and spacing is wrong sometimes.
* All characters with two extensions shall be implemented; All bottom Primary character extension glyphs shall be implemented.
* Kerning pairs have to be added for some characters to look well. In particular Secondary Case + Aspect/Validation pairs. It is unknown how to kern the characters with a diacritic between them.
* Horizontal part consonantal extensions shall be reworked to change the form of the line.
* Vertically inverted characters with top extensions shall be adjusted vertically so that the extension is positioned below baseline.
* This means merging algorythm should be improved to account for moving. If this difficult task is accomplished, it will also bring a lot of other benefits.

## Fixing and improving

There’s a lot of work to do with the font, and any help will be appreciated. Feel free to hack on whatever you feel can be improved, and send the pull request. Any error reports and suggestions on how the font can be improved are also heartily welcome. The author is /u/mnyonpa on Reddit.
